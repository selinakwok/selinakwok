## Hello, I'm Selina :)
I love to build things and solve problems through technology and coding!

My journey into programming actually began with a degree in Geography, which taught me to approach complex systems with curiosity.
This curiosity led me to teach myself programming, and I realized how much I enjoy building tools to solve problems and improve efficiency.
With this passion I have now transitioned to a master's degree in Computer Science, where I am honing my skills in software development.
I am deeply committed to learning and improving my skills, always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my knowledge.
